## Problem 1

> Is Spotify’s reaction to the Panama Playlists appropriate given their own
  collection of data?

Spotify has accused Tim, the creator of the Panama Playlist, of violating the
terms of the agreement and has taken legal action against the
release.<sup>[\[1\]]</sup> It is fair to point out that this accusation is
hypocritical, given that Spotify collects far more data points than Tim and has
made playlist sharing public by default.

However, I find their response to be appropriate because the act of scraping is
clearly prohibited in the user agreement.<sup>[\[2\]]</sup> Regardless of Tim’s
opinion about scraping and discussions of its legality, he signed the agreement
when he created his account, thus providing grounds for Spotify to take action.

## Problem 2

> Given Spotify’s policies, is the web scraping that was done to create the
  Panama Playlists problematic?

I personally do not think that scraping information from web pages is
problematic. According to a US court in 2017, when a company sued LinkedIn for
revoking its access for web scraping, scraping is allowed as long as the
information is publicly available.<sup>[\[3\]]</sup> The court acknowledged that
the company in question had violated the terms of service, but stated that the
violation did not amount to theft.
