# [Homework 4](https://github.com/hanggrian/IIT-CS579/raw/assets/assignments/hw4.pdf)

> Each student has been assigned a Community Area (1-77) to explore. You will
  use data from [census.gov](https://www.census.gov/) to do an analysis of your
  CA using census data from the ACS (block group level) and decennial census
  (block level). Depending on the number of block groups in your CA, you may
  consider the broader geographic neighborhood of your CA as well (see
  instructions below). The deliverables are:

## Problem 1

> A data-based characterization of your CA including the recent history (back
  to 2010) of your CA.

## Problem 2

> A description of the data (i.e. variables) that you have chosen to use as the
  basis of your study along with a discussion of why you chose these variables
  and any preliminary analysis you did to narrow the data. You will choose at
  least 6 variables that are available at the block group level (i.e. from the
  ACS)

## Problem 3

> An analysis of similarity of the block groups that comprise your CA. If your
  CA has less than 60 block groups, you will add the block groups of geographic
  neighbors to get at least 60 block groups. This analysis should include
  modeling the block groups as a network.
>
> 1.  You will describe the modeling and analysis you did, stating assumptions
      and justifying decisions.
> 1.  You will provide data-based arguments including visualizations to support
      why your CA is a community.
> 1.  You will provide data-based arguments including visualizations to support
      why your CA is not a community.
> 1.  You will provide a proposal for alternative community(ies). If your CA has
      60 or more block groups, this will be a proposal for organizations of
      communities within your CA. If your CA has <60 block groups, you will
      propose an organization of block groups from your CA and neighbors
      (resulting in analysis of 60 or more). This proposal should include
      visualizations.

## Problem 4

> If you are working in a team, there is an additional step where you will put
  all your data together and propose an organization of communities. Each team
  member must have a unique CA so if your team has duplicates, please email me
  asap.

## Problem 5

> The above should be compiled into a report that includes citations and
  transcripts of any AI assistance. You will submit a pdf and code.
