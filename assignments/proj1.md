# Final project: Proposal

> The final project is an extension of your analysis from HW 4. You are required
  to include the following: Chicago Community Areas, Census data, Network
  modeling and analysis, and Geographic mapping/visualization. Beyond this,
  there are many different ways to extend your analysis from HW 4 (e.g. include
  all CAs, include additional census data, include data from other sources,
  include additional analysis methods, etc.).

## Problem 1

> What is the goal of your project? How will you extend what you did for HW 4?

Previously, in *Homework 4,* the census analysis was limited to socioeconomic
factors in a single community area. In the final project, I plan to extend the
coverage to all Chicago community areas while reducing the scope of analysis to
a certain population with **means of transportation** to work. The goal is to
study how access to public transportation affects people's decision to own a
personal vehicle. For example, sections of community areas furthest away from L
transit, such as the Far North Side and Far Southeast Side, are expected to have
higher percentage of people who drive to work.

## Problem 2

> What motivates this extension? What data will you use?

This project will reuse the census datasets from Homework 4, including
[2010 Decennial](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/decennial-census/2010.html),
[2020 Decennial](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/decennial-census/2020.html)
and [2019-2023 ACS 5-Year Estimates](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/table-and-geography-changes/2023/5-year.html). To
determine which community areas have access to public transportation, I will use
the most recent [L transit map](https://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/6/ctamap_Lsystem.png)
from CTA. It is notable that, while there is a new Pink Line extension that
opened in 2006, it does not cover any new community area and therefore will not
affect the analysis. In another note, bus routes will not be considered in this
project due to rapid changes in routes and schedules over the years, making the
information unreliable for historical analysis.

I am particularly interested in the topic of public transportation, being an
international student who relies heavily on it for daily commute. Given that
some community areas, like Loop, have always had easy access to L transit, I
wonder whether trust in the public transportation system has improved over the
years by observing the trend of vehicle ownership in those areas.

## Problem 3

> What will be the most challenging part of the project?

The most challenging part of this project will be to correctly determine whether
access to public transportation is the most relevant factor impacting the means
of transportation to work. If no such correlation can be found, I will need to
include other socioeconomic factors, such as education level and employment
status.
