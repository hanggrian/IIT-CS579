# Extra credit #4: Homework #4

> How can *Homework 4* be extended?
>
> - Similarity across all CAs.
>
>   Analyze moving/commute along with traffic data (Illimois Dept. of
    Transportation) Chicago data portal bus/subway rides.
> - Compare larger geographic area (i.e. all Southside CAs).
> - Use more census variables.

The simplest way to extend Homework #4 is to include more datasets, such as
[Decennial 2000 data](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/decennial-census.2000.html).
This would provide a comprehensive view from 2000 to 2023.

Besides more datasets, we can also make a connection between socioeconomic
variables in census data and external datasets. For example, means of
transportation to work and community areas with access to public transit data
from [Chicago Transit Authority](https://www.transitchicago.com/) can be
compared to see if there is a correlation between vehicle ownership and access
to public transportation. In another example, crime data from
[Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2/about_data) can be compared with indicators like income level, poverty rate and
employment status.
