## Slide 1

- Hi! I'm Hendra, and today I'll be presenting my progress on the final project:
  - the impact of the CTA "L" train on Chicago vehicle ownership,
  - as part of the Online Social Network Analysis course.

## Slide 2

> ![Slide 2](https://github.com/hanggrian/IIT-CS579/raw/assets/assignments/proj2/slide2.png)

- I chose this topic because, as you can imagine, I use CTA to go to the
  university.
- And, also because...

## Slide 3

> ![Slide 3](https://github.com/hanggrian/IIT-CS579/raw/assets/assignments/proj2/slide3.png)

- Based on my initial study, the "L" train routes cover 55% of Chicago community
  areas.
- With half of the majority areas covered,
  - and businesses are usually concentrated around train stations:
  - I believe public transportation has a significant impact on vehicle
    ownership.

## Slide 4

- To prove this, the project will analyze the population with means of
  transportation to work or study.
- Then, compare changes in "L" train routes over the years,
  - we want to see if a new train station or line extension covers a new
    community area.
- Finally, compare vehicle ownership between regions with and without access to
  at least one station.

## Slide 5

- The project will reuse all components from *Homework 4* and some new datasets.

## Slide 6

> ![Slide 6](https://github.com/hanggrian/IIT-CS579/raw/assets/assignments/proj2/slide6.png)

- Before I start, it is important to note that,
  - although CTA ridership is improving,
  - it is still nowhere near pre-pandemic levels.
- This may affect the analysis results, but only from the year 2020 onward.

## Slide 7

> ![Slide 7](https://github.com/hanggrian/IIT-CS579/raw/assets/assignments/proj2/slide7.png)

- The reused datasets from *Homework 4* are the Census and the Chicago Data
  Portal, with a new addition of the Decennial 2000.
- The project will also reuse the same tools: Python packages to fetch, process
  and visualize the data.
- Finally, the deliverables will include a PDF report, source code and
  PowerPoint presentation.

## Slide 8

> ![Slide 8](https://github.com/hanggrian/IIT-CS579/raw/assets/assignments/proj2/slide8.png)

- There are also new sources of datasets for this project:
  - **Chicago-L.org** provides a historical map of "L" train routes, including
    station locations and line extensions.
  - and the **Illinois Secretary of State** website for the total count of
    vehicles registered in Chicago.

## Slide 9

> ![Slide 9](https://github.com/hanggrian/IIT-CS579/raw/assets/assignments/proj2/slide9.png)

- This section shows the project outline.

## Slide 10

> ![Slide 10](https://github.com/hanggrian/IIT-CS579/raw/assets/assignments/proj2/slide10.png)

- First, find the correct table IDs related to commuting from the Census data.
- I need to repeat this step for all considered years.

## Slide 11

> ![Slide 11](https://github.com/hanggrian/IIT-CS579/raw/assets/assignments/proj2/slide11.png)

- Then, compare the population with means of transportation to vehicle counts.
- For example, in 2023,
  - we can see that the number of vehicles exceeds the population who drive
    alone,
  - suggesting that a small portion of the population owns multiple vehicles.

## Slide 12

> ![Slide 12](https://github.com/hanggrian/IIT-CS579/raw/assets/assignments/proj2/slide12.png)

- Finally, track changes in "L" train routes over the years.
- I imagine this would be the most challenging part of the project.
- The latest routes are available as interactive maps online,
  - but older routes are only available as static images.

## Slide 13

> ![Slide 13](https://github.com/hanggrian/IIT-CS579/raw/assets/assignments/proj2/slide13.png)

- As the President of Colombia once said,
  - "A developed country isn't a place where the poor have cars. It's where the
    rich use public transportation."

## Slide 14

- With that, I conclude my presentation.
- Thank you for your attention.
