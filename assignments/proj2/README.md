# Final project: Progress

> You will create a presentation about your progress on the final project to
  date and then submit a video of you/your team presenting the slides. Each
  student should speak and the speaker should be shown in the video while they
  are presenting. The video should be 2-4 minutes long.
>
> The presentation should include:
>
> - Intro slide with the title of the project and student name(s).
> - A summary of the project components clearly illustrating pieces that are
    being reused from HW 4 along with other components and how the components
    fit together.
> - A plan for completing the project highlighting the starting point (what was
    done for HW4) and the steps to be completed along with discussion on
    progress made to date.
